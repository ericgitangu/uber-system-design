# Lean Production-Grade Infrastructure for Uber-like System

## Executive Summary

This document presents a streamlined, cost-effective infrastructure design that maintains production-grade reliability while reducing operational complexity and costs. The lean approach focuses on managed services, automation, and simplified architecture patterns.

## Lean Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
1. **Managed Services First**: Leverage cloud provider managed services
2. **Automation by Default**: Infrastructure and deployment automation
3. **Observability Built-in**: Monitoring and alerting from day one
4. **Security by Design**: Security controls integrated throughout
5. **Cost Optimization**: Right-sizing and efficient resource utilization

## Simplified Architecture Components
